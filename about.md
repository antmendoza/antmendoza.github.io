Senior Java Developer, I am working remotely from UK for the University of Murcia.

I have been working for more than ten years in Java related projects, taking part in the design and development of core elements in both back-end and front-end.

Keeping an eye on BPM trends (I am a big fan of jBPM & Drools) and always interested in learning new ways to build software, I am now focused on improving my skills in software testing.

### Side projects:
Technical book Reviewer of two books:

- [Maven Essentials (12/2015)][1]
- [jBPM6 Developer Guide (08/2014)][2]

Speaker at internal tech talks (Spanish):

- [Introduction to jBPM (11/2014)][3]
- [Introduction to Drools (01/2015)][4]
